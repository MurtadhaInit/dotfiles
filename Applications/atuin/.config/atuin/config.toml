## prevent commands matching any of these regexes from being written to history.
## Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't start
## with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in the command.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see
## https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
# history_filter = [

## prevent commands run with cwd matching any of these regexes from being written
## to history. Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't

## Defaults to true. This matches history against a set of default regex, and will not save it if we get a match. Defaults include

## 2. Github pat (old and new)
## 3. Slack oauth tokens (bot, user)
## 4. Slack webhooks

## Defaults to "emacs".  This specifies the keymap on the startup of `atuin
## search`.  If this is set to "auto", the startup keymap mode in the Atuin
## search is automatically selected based on the shell's keymap where the

## the specified one.

## Set commands that will be completely ignored from stats
# ignored_commands = [
#   "cd",

[keys]
# Defaults to true. If disabled, using the up/down key won't exit the TUI when scrolled past the first/last entry.
# scroll_exits = false

[sync]
# Enable sync v2 by default
# This ensures that sync v2 is enabled for new installs only
# In a later release it will become the default across the board
